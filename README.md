# PGM Image Processing

This program allows to do basic operations on pgm files.
Functions:
-mirror
-spin k * 90deg
-create histogram
-thershold
-negative
-add some noise
-gauss and median filter
-add some colors - create ppm file based on loaded pgm using LookUp table
There are two 'add colors' functions based on different tables.
One is randomly filled and the other one (the boring one) is orderly like 
rainbow spectrum.
One can load several pics into the program and change pic to work with.
The result can be saved in new file.
